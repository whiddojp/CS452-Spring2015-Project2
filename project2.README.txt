Avoid Touching the flying Face, you will die.
If you press 1 after touching the lava or getting hit (dying) you restart (Saves highscore, resets points, resets positioning)
If you press F9 or F8 if turns the Lighting on and off, respectively.

Scoring System:
For every objective you acquire you recieve a point.

Win or Lose?
If you touch the the red area (Almost reminds you of lava right?) then you lose.
If you touch the the flying face then you lose.
If you make it to 20 points you win, but can continue in order to painstakingly crawl ahead of the high score.
