CS452/EE465 Computer Graphics Spring 2015
Project #2
due: Thursday, 4/23/15 at midnight

The second project will be a 3D WebGL application. You may work on this project in teams of two. One possibility is
to write a 3D game, but alternatives will be considered.  In all cases, a written proposal must be approved by 
Prof. Searleman no later than Tuesday, April 7th.

Objectives:
-Use 3D Shapes
-Shapes move in 3D
-There is user interaction
-There is lighting and texturing


Requirements:
1. vertex coordinates are not in the default range - a (non identity) Model-View matrix is required.
2. use webgl-utils.js, initShaders.js and MV.js from Angel
3. three files are required in the solution: project2.html, project2.js and project2.README.txt. The
project2.README.txt file will contain your name(s) and the date along with a brief description of your
project. Be sure to include complete details of how to interact with your application. As before, all 
files should contain a comment including your name(s) and date.
